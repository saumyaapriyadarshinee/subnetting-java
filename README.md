Subnetting Calculator

This is a Python/Java-based subnetting calculator that helps you break down an IP address into subnet details, including the subnet mask, hosts per subnet, and the first and last usable hosts. The program accepts an IP address and CIDR notation as input and calculates the necessary details.

Features

Input an IP address and CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

Calculate the subnet mask.

Calculate the number of hosts per subnet.

Determine the first and last usable IP addresses for each subnet.

Display the results in a user-friendly format.
Usage

1. Enter the IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.0).


2. Enter the CIDR notation (e.g., /24).


3. The program will calculate:

Subnet Mask

Hosts per subnet

First Host

Last Host
